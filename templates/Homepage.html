        Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disease characterised by the accumulation of protein deposits in the brain, 
        leading to brain shrinkage and cell death. This degenerative disease ultimately affects memory, thinking, behaviour and social skills. 
        As Alzheimer's disease progresses, it leads to a decline in cognitive function and quality of life, affecting daily functioning and independence. 
        The accumulation of proteins disrupts normal brain function, leading to a range of neurological symptoms that worsen over time, 
        determining the course of this debilitating disease.

      <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that targets the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. 
        A faulty attack on nerve fibres by the immune system is a hallmark of the disease. Symptoms of MS often include mobility problems, 
        such as difficulty walking, vision problems, and cognitive problems. The effects of this autoimmune disease on the nervous system result in a range 
        of debilitating symptoms that vary in severity and progression, and in their impact on the individual, highlighting the complexity of managing and treating MS.

      <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        Dementia is a condition caused by various diseases that damage brain cells and disrupt communication between them. 
        The disruption of cell-to-cell communication leads to cognitive impairment, which affects memory, reasoning and behaviour. 
        Symptoms of dementia may manifest as changes in mood and behaviour, including confusion and agitation. People with dementia often struggle 
        with complex tasks and problem solving, reflecting the challenges of cognitive decline. Dealing with dementia involves addressing these 
        cognitive deficits, providing support to the person and their carers, and adapting strategies to improve the person's quality of life 
        in the face of this debilitating condition.

      <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; line-height: 1.8;">
        Parkinson's disease is a neurological condition that impairs the brain's ability to produce dopamine, an important neurotransmitter. 
        The initial symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be divided into two main categories. The first is called 'motor symptoms', which include 
        movement-related problems such as tremors, slowness of movement, and difficulties with balance and co-ordination. On the other hand, 
        'non-motor symptoms' include a range of problems such as pain, anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and cognitive impairment. 
        The multifaceted nature of Parkinson's disease highlights the different ways in which it affects individuals, both in terms of motor function 
        and overall well-being. Early detection and comprehensive management strategies are essential to address the complexity of this progressive 
        neurodegenerative disease.
